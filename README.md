Serialization and Deserialization	

Serialization and deserialization are fundamental processes in computer science that enable the conversion of data structures or object states into a format that can be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed later.
Serialization is a mechanism for converting the state of an object into a byte stream. 
Deserialization is a reverse process where the byte stream is used to re-create the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.
